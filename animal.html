	<h3> Scottish Folds </h3>
	<font face="times new roman">
	<font color="darkblue">The Scottish Fold is a medium-size cat with a rounded head and big round eyes, although he is known for his standout feature: ears that fold forward, giving him the appearance of a furry owl. His coat, which comes in many colors and patterns, can be short or long. The longhaired variety is known as the Highland Fold. </font>
